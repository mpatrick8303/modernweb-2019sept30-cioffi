# Chapter 6: Lab 3 Create and call functions

## Steps

1. In `/js` create a file called `functions.js` and do your work in this file. 

1. Create a function called `displayName` which takes in a variable and displays the following message using console.log(). You can call the incoming data anything you want, it is your local reference to the data being passed in. If you need help, or to continue, scroll down.
    ```
    Hello, name-you-passed-in
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    ```
    ```javascript         
    function displayName(name) {
        console.log('Hello, ' + name)
    }
    ```

1. Execute this function by adding this line after its definition:
    ```javascript
    displayName("Your name");
    ```

## Bonus

1. Look up the formulas to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and vice-versa:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit

1. Write functions to take in one value and convert to the other.

1. Name them well, and inputs, and test that: 
    1. 212째F is 100째C
    1. 60째C is 140 째F
