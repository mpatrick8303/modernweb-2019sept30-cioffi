# Chapter 7: Exercise: Transpiling

## Objectives
* In this lab, you will write code using ES6 notation
* Create a new package.json using npm init
* Install packages locally 
* Use babel to transpile code from ES6 to ES5
* If you need additional help, you can refer to the appropriate `/Demos` directory. 

### Estimated Completion Time 
30 minutes


## Steps:

1. Create a directory in your project called `ES6`. You will do your work in this directory in creating a new project.

1. To manage our new project's dependencies, including for babel, we will create a `package.json` by using the `npm init` wizard from the command line. Be sure to be within `\ES6` when you execute this command 
    ```
    npm init --yes
    ``` 
    
    The `--yes`, or `-y` accepts all the defaults from the wizard.

1. Create a `src` directory for scripts, and to this directory, copy the `hobbies.js` file from the same directory as this README.md.  

1. Create an `index.html` file in the directory of `\ES6`. You can use the html:5 template.

1. Include a script reference like this:
    ``` javascript
    <script src="src/hobbies.js"></script>
    ```

1. Open `index.html` in Chrome and verify in the console area of devtools that it works.

1. Open in IE11 and verify that it does not work. It does not understand the ES6 syntax.

1. READ ONLY (make no changes): There are several ways to "transpile" code from ES6 down to ES5. One way is using babel. It can be used several ways including from the command line. One approach would be to install babel globally. Installing globally isn't always desirable. It makes it harder to manage the versions of the tools being used and can cause developers more manual work.

   
1. Open the `package.json` and look at the dependency sections. It's currently empty. Close the file.

1. Add the babel CLI to the new package.json dev dependencies with this command:
    ```
    npm install --save-dev babel-cli
    ```

    a shortcut for `--save-dev` is

    ```
    npm install -D babel-cli
    ```

1. Open the `package.json` and look at the new entries in the dev dependencies section. Close the file.

1. READ: You may notice a `package-lock.json` file being created. This file tracks the different dependencies and versions of packages in your node_modules directory. (https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json)

1. Add a `babel-preset-env` to the dev dependencies. Babel uses this to know how to transpile to a specific version.
    ```
    npm install babel-preset-env -D
    ```

1. The last thing needed for the setup is a configuration file called `.babelrc`. Create this file in your main project directory - at the same level as your `package.json` file. In this file, add this content, which specifies to use the preset we just installed.
    ```
    {
    "presets": [
        ["env", {
        "targets": {
            "browsers": [
            "Chrome >= 52",
            "FireFox >= 44",
            "Safari >= 7",
            "Explorer 11",
            "last 4 Edge versions"
            ]
        },
        "useBuiltIns": true
        }]
    ] 
    }
    ```

1. READ (take no action): we want to execute the babel command to turn our ES6 code into ES5. 

    Because you have installed `babel` into node_modules, you could specify the CLI tool in the node_modules directory like this: 
    
    ```
    ./node_modules/.bin/babel src --out-dir dist
    ```

1. Instead of the command line, let's add the use of babel in the package.json `build` script so that it is easily repeatable and part of our development build process. 

    Find the location of the existing `"scripts"` property in `package.json`. You may already have a property there, for example for `test`. 
    
    You can have more than one script - as the value is an object, it would need to be comma separated.

    We are not using test yet, you can remove this entry and replace it with `build` as shown. 
    ```
    "scripts": {
        "build": "babel src --watch --presets babel-preset-env --out-dir dist"
    },
    ```
    Notice you do not need to include the path to `node_modules` - it will be found as part of npm running the script.

  
1. The `--watch` indicates to watch for changes in the src directory, and keep transpiling whenever a file is added or changed.

1. Start the build process using the command: `npm run build`. Notice that your terminal window does not return to the prompt because it is listening for changes to your `src` directory. Keep this running as you are about to add more code.
 
  
1. Look in the `/dist` directory at the transpiled file. Examine the contents: you should now see ES5 type concatenation instead of backticks and anonymous function use instead of an arrow function.

1. Update the `index.html` to use this new `/dist/myHobbies.js` version of the hobbies JS file.

1. Reload the IE browser. Is it working?

    Because of the use of Array.prototype's foreach, it is necessary to add in code to use a shim for IE11. Babel did not take care of this. (as of Jan 2019)

    Insert this in your HTML before the inclusion of the hobbies script.

    ```html
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/4.5.7/es5-shim.min.js"></script>
    ```

    You should now see output in the dev tools console for both Chrome and IE.

1. Mark your work as complete and then attempt the bonus

## BONUS

1. Modify your html page to create a `div` to hold the hobbies, and add JavaScript to call a function to update the div.
    ```
    <div id="hobbiesInfo"></div>

    <script>document.getElementById("hobbiesInfo").innerHTML=returnHobbiesHTML()</script>  
    ```

1. In `src/hobbies.js`, write the `returnHobbiesHTML` function  file to return a string of hobby information, which includes HTML tags such as `<br />` or `<li>`. You can use ES6 backticks. Scroll down for a hint or to continue.

    ```javascript






















    function returnHobbiesHTML() {
        let hobbyInfo = `
            <ul>
        `;
        hobbiesArray.forEach(hobby => {
            hobbyInfo+= `<li>${hobby.name} ${hobby.lengthInYearsAtHobby}</li>`;
            });
            hobbyInfo+=`</ul>`;
        return hobbyInfo;
    }

    ```

1. When you save the JS file again, notice the console indicates that the dist folder was updated. 

1. Test in Chrome and IE. When it is working, mark your work as complete. 


1. Add the functionality to display the hobbies in a table. Using backticks makes it easier to create html in JS and use classes. 

1. Add a style attribute to the table to add styling. 

1. npx also allows you to execute tools not installed. One-off. They take a little longer to run because they are downloaded, but then you don't have to clean up your npm local repos or package.json file. Try these out:
    ```
    npx cowsay Say something

    npx happy-birthday -u YourName

    npx benny-hill
    ```

1. You can specify different browser versions with babel. Check out

1. You can look at the docs on `package.json` https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json

1. Read over the documentation for `Arrays.prototype` there are many useful functions for processing data. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype
